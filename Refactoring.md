Refactoring Vim structurally and aesthetically, is an important goal of Neovim. But there are some modules that should not be changed significantly, because they are maintained only by Bram, at present. Until someone takes "ownership" of these modules, the cost of any significant changes (including style or structural changes that re-arrange the code) to these modules outweighs the benefit. The modules are:

- `regexp.c`
- `regexp_nfa.c`
- `syntax.c`
