### Introduction
In many different tasks, the need arises to refactor integer types, mainly to:
- avoid errors because of mixing of signed/unsigned types and implicit conversions.
- emphasize size semantics where appropriate.
- conform with system functions returning `size_t` values without the need of casting. 
- ensure no unneeded limits are imposed on sizes of things we can operate on.
- avoid possible data truncation because of explicit casting.
- etc.

It's important to agree on how this kind of refactoring should be done.
However: 

- This is a difficult thing to get completely right. No hard-and-fast set of rules will match every possible situation.
- **This set of guidelines intends to be a framework establishing principles** to help new people to confront these problems, and for more experienced people to have a consensus so that code is homogeneous. 
- **It does not intend to be a set of mechanical rules to be applied without further thinking, or to be dogmatic about**.
- Every particular case should be carefully analyzed before taking actions on it.

That said, here goes the advice:

### Long types
- `long_u` with size semantics (all, or mostly all) --> `size_t`
- `long_u` without size semantics (rare, if ever) --> `uint64_t`
- `long` with size semantics:
    * signedness conversion easy --> `size_t` <br/>
       (check for signedness conversion usual problems).
    * signedness conversion difficult --> `ssize`  <br/>
       (for example, complicated code involving subtractions) <br/>
       Note: `ssize` is a project-wide typedef defined in `src/nvim/types.h`.
- `long` without size semantics --> `int64_t`

### Int types
- `int` with size semantics:
    * signedness conversion easy --> `size_t` <br/>
       (check for signedness conversion usual problems).
    * signedness conversion difficult --> `ssize` <br/>
       (for example, complicated code involving subtractions) 
- `int` without size semantics --> `int`

### Special cases
In spite of the general advice above, there are some cases where we prefer more tight typing.

#### Struct fields
We should try to keep structs small, if possible. To that end:
- Use fixed width types (`int32_t`, `uint32_t`, etc.), if possible. This is:
- Do that only if you can be sure that the specified width will always be enough. So:
- Please don't impose arbitrary/unneeded limits on fields. 
- For example: If a field has clear size semantics and there's no particular reason to impose a restriction on it, use `size_t`/`ssize`.

#### External interfaces
- For functions interfacing other processes over a transport/serialization mechanism, fixed-width types are preferred. For example, in `msgpack_rpc.h`:

  ```c
bool msgpack_rpc_integer_result(uint32_t result,
                                msgpack_object *req,
                                msgpack_packer *res);
```

- For functions part of a public API, native types are preferred. For example, in a hypothetical `libneovim.h`:

  ```c
int neovim_get_current_buffer(void);
```

### Type cascading
Once you have some input variable you have to deal with (be it a struct field, a function parameter, or even a global), the issue arises whether to cascade that type in code dealing with it, or using a wider type if considered better for some reason. Typical example is, once you have a fixed-width struct field, code dealing with it (function variables/parameters) should also use fixed-width types, or could types we widened to some other enclosing type? In principle, we say:
- If access to input variable is read-only, then it's safe to use wider types if some other reason makes them preferable, as you will be only upcasting the value.
- If access to input variable can be read/write, then intermediate variables/params should try to maintain input variable's type as much as possible. If not, you will end up with a downcast somewhere that will require an assert/some other kind of guard/error handling.

### Loops
We find [this](http://gustedt.wordpress.com/2013/07/15/a-praise-of-size_t-and-other-unsigned-types/) pretty convincing, taking great care not to incurr in errors described [here](http://www.eschertech.com/articles/items/art100407.html). From that, we conclude:

In loops, we have a *counter* variable and a *limit* expression (*condition* being a comparison between *counter* and *limit*). Issues can arise mainly because of implicit conversions in *limit* expression, as well as mixing different-signedness types in *condition* (i.e., when *counter* and *limit* have types of different signedness). To avoid/reduce implicit conversion and type-signedness-mixing problems:

- If possible, try to avoid different-signedness types in variables within *limit* expression (many errors are because implicit conversion from signed type to unsigned one).
- In principle, *limit* expression's type determines *counter*'s type. If *limit* expression is `size_t`, so is counter. If *limit* expression is `ssize`, so is counter. And so on.
- If resulting type of *counter* and *limit* is unsigned:
    * Check *limit* expression  for frontier values (e.g., when size is zero).
    * Avoid *condition* using substractions (unless guarded so that it can be proved for result to always be positive). Prefer equivalent condition using additions on the other side.
- As an optimization, you could use plain `int` instead of `ssize`, or `unsigned int` instead of `size_t`, but only if you are sure that those types will be enough always. Please try not to impose arbitrary/unneeded limits.
