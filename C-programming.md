### C programming techniques and Neovim-specific guidance

##### Unsigned or signed? Beware of integer over- and underflow

There are a few very important things to keep in mind while choosing between signed and unsigned integral types:

Firstly, **unsigned overflow is defined**, while **signed overflow is not**. This is an unfortunate historical oversight stemming from a time where it wasn't sure what [representation a signed integer would have](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18195715/why-is-unsigned-integer-overflow-defined-behavior-but-signed-integer-overflow-is). The C standard decided that it shouldn't/couldn't specify what would happen when a signed integer overflows, because each representation would have different behaviour. In modern times, signed integers are always represented in [two's complement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement) form, which has many advantages. 

> An interesting thing to note is that it is possible to force gcc and clang to view signed overflow as defined (wraparound, like unsigned), by [passing the -fwrapv flag](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4712784/558819). This is, unfortunately, non-standard.

What does this mean, defined vs. undefined? If an unsigned integer overflows, it wraps around back to zero (it's modulo addition). Yet, if a signed integer overflows, $deity only knows what will happen. More specifically: we _know_ what would happen if a two's complement signed integer would overflow, but [the compiler can do whatever it wants, because the standard says it is undefined](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18195756/558819). As a consequence, an optimizing compiler will often assume that a signed integer _cannot_ overflow (please insert mahkoh's undefined behaviour example here) and optimize out some if-branches or comparisons. This behaviour can cause loops to run forever. Note that if the conditions are not written carefully, even the well-defined wraparound overflow of unsigned integers can cause non-terminating loops, `(U)INTX_MAX/MIN` are your friends.

Thus it would seem that unsigned arithmetic is superior, because it has defined over- and underflow. But that's not always true. There's a good reason why many languages (like Java) don't expose unsigned types: they can cause difficult to spot errors. The most common form of `*`flow is **underflow in unsigned arithmetic**. Subtracting 1 from `unsigned int num = 0;` will make it wrap around to `UINT_MAX`. [This is much more common than one would think](http://www.soundsoftware.ac.uk/c-pitfall-unsigned). For this reason alone, it is usually **much** safer to use a plain `int` as a loop counter instead of `uint32_t`/`size_t`/... or another unsigned type. Even seasoned programmers find it difficult to avoid writing unsigned code that doesn't underflow in some cases. That's why

**Problem**: correct signed code is easier to write, but you have to use casts when comparing to `size_t` (which happens often, as it is the return type of `sizeof`, `strlen` and many others). Casts are ugly and should be avoided if at all possible. But we cannot avoid them everywhere. Sometimes, a trade-off has to be made. Hopefully this section can be amended with examples showing good ways to handle these issues.

**Conclusion**: 

- if there is any chance of underflow or the loop in question is small (definitely less than `2^31` items), use signed arithmetic and a guard before the loop.
- if there is any chance of overflow, use unsigned arithmetic and possibly guards.
- if there is a chance of both underflow and overflow, be extremely careful and paranoid (guards/asserts).

##### Fixed-size vs. generic types

Should we use `(u)intX_t` and friends over `char`, `short`, `int`, `long` et al.? ...
