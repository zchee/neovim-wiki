_See **[Quickstart](#quickstart)** to get started immediately. Also note the section on [**Not Applicable**](#na-not-applicable-patches) patches._

Neovim was forked from Vim 7.4.160; it is kept up-to-date with relevant Vim patches in order to avoid duplicate work.  Run [`vim-patch.sh`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/scripts/vim-patch.sh) to see the status of Vim patches: 

    ./scripts/vim-patch.sh -l

Everyone is welcome to [send pull requests](#pull-requests) for relevant Vim patches, but some types of patches are [not applicable](#na-not-applicable-patches).

Quickstart
----------

1. Pull down the Neovim source:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
   ```
2. Run `./scripts/vim-patch.sh -l` to see the list of missing Vim patches.
3. Choose a patch from the list (usually the _oldest_ one), e.g. `8.0.0123`.
   -  Check for [open vim-patch PRs](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Avim-patch).
4. Run `./scripts/vim-patch.sh -p 8.0.0123`
5. Follow the instructions given by the script.

### Notes

* It's strongly recommended to work on the _oldest_ missing patch, because later patches might depend on the changes.
* Use `git log -G` to search the Nvim/Vim source history (even _deleted_ code). E.g. to find `reset_option_was_set`:
  ```
  git log -p -G reset_option_was_set
  ```

Pull requests
-------------

_Note:_ **[vim-patch.sh](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/scripts/vim-patch.sh)** automates these steps for you. Use it!

- Install [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) or git-hub if you want to use `vim-patch.sh` to create PRs automatically
    - There should be a [configuration file](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/978) `~/.config/hub` when you are using 2FA in GitHub
- The pull request *title* should include `vim-patch:8.0.xxxx` (no whitespace) 
- The [*commit message*](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/4ccf1125ff569eccfc34abc4ad794044c5ab7455) should include:
    - A token indicating the Vim patch number, formatted as follows: <br/>
     `vim-patch:8.0.0123` (no whitespace)
    - A URL pointing to the Vim commit:
        - https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/c8020ee825b9d9196b1329c0e097424576fc9b3a
    - The original Vim commit message, including author

**Reviewers:** [hint for reviewing `runtime/` patches](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1744#issuecomment-68202876)

NA ("Not Applicable") patches
------------------------------

Many Vim patches are not applicable to Neovim. If you find NA patches, visit the ["version.c: update" pull request](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pulls/marvim) and mention the NA patches in a comment (please edit/update *one* comment, rather than adding a new comment for each patch).

If you are working on a series of patches, you may notice some "Not Applicable" patches. In that case you may want to mark the NA patches a commit message, using this format _exactly_ (each patch on a separate line):

    vim-patch:<version-or-commit>
    vim-patch:<version-or-commit>
    ...

where `<version-or-commit>` is a valid Vim version (like `8.0.0123`) or commit-id (SHA).

### Types of "Not Applicable" Vim patches:

- Updates to `testdir/Makefile` are usually NA because the Makefile [implicitly finds](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/8a677f8a4bff6005fa39f090c14e970c3dfdbe6e#diff-b3c6ad6680a25a1b42095879e3a87104R52) all `test_*.vim` files.
- **Compiler warning fixes**: Neovim strives to have no warnings at all, and has a very different build system from Vim.
    - **Note:** Coverity fixes in Vim *are* relevant to Neovim.
- **#ifdef tweaking**: For example, Vim decided to enable `FEAT_VISUAL` for all platforms — but Neovim already does that. Adding new `FEAT_` guards also isn't relevant to Neovim.
- **Legacy system support**: Fixes for legacy systems such as Amiga, OS/2 Xenix, Mac OS 9, Windows older than XP SP2, are not needed because they are not supported by Neovim.
- **`if_*.c`** changes: `if_python.c` et. al. were removed.
- **term.c** changes: the Neovim TUI uses libtermkey to read terminal sequences; Vim's `term.c` was removed.
- `:terminal` patches
- `defaults.vim` patches
- Most **GUI-related** changes: Neovim GUIs are implemented external to the core C codebase.
- Anything else might be relevant; err on the side of caution, and post an issue if you aren't sure. 

version.c
---------

The list of Vim patches in `src/nvim/version.c` is [automatically updated](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7780) based on the presence of `vim-patch:xxx` tokens in the Neovim git log.

- Don't update `src/nvim/version.c` yourself.
  - `scripts/vim-patch.sh -p` intentionally omits `version.c` to avoid merge conflicts and save time when porting a patch.
- The automation script (`scripts/vimpatch.lua`) only recognizes tokens like `vim-patch:8.0.1206`, not `vim-patch:<hash>`.

Make sure to note the difference between `utf_` and `utfc_` when replacing `mb_` functions. Also indirect call syntax `(*mb_ptr2len)(...)` should be replaced with an ordinary function call `utfc_ptr2len(...)`.

- Vim's `ga_init2` was renamed to `ga_init` and the original `ga_init` is gone.
- "Old style" Vim tests (`src/testdir/*.in`) should be converted to Lua tests (see [#1286](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1286) and [#1328](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1328)). See [Checklist for migrating legacy tests][checklist]. 
    - However, please _do not_ convert "new style" Vim tests (`src/testdir/*.vim`) to Lua. The "new style" Vim tests are faster than the old ones, and converting them takes time and effort better spent elsewhere. Just copy them to `src/nvim/testdir/*.vim` and update `src/nvim/testdir/Makefile`.
- Conditions that check `enc_utf8` or `has_mbyte` are obsolete (only the "true" case is applicable).
- List management has changed in Neovim, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/List-management-in-Neovim).

Documentation differences
-------------------------

The following should be removed from all imported documentation, and not be used in new documentation:

- `{not in Vi}` : we don't care about compatibility with Vi (see [`818f7ae`][vi-annotations]).
- `{Only when compiled with ...}` - the vast majority of features have been made non-optional (see [Introduction](Introduction#legacy-support-and-compile-time-features))
